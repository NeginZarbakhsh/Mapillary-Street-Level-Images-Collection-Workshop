# Mapillary Street-Level Images Collection Workshop

Welcome to the Mapillary Street-Level Images Collection Workshop repository! This project focuses on data analytics and Python approaches for retrieving and analyzing street-level images using crowdsourced data. It was developed as part of a workshop I conducted for 35 students at UCD, guiding both undergraduate computer science and master's remote sensing students through practical coding exercises to enhance their skills.

## Workshop Overview
- **Participants**: 35 students (Undergraduate Computer Science and Master's Remote Sensing)
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Introduction to using street-level images for urban computing and smart cities
  - Hands-on experience with Python for data extraction and analysis
  - Techniques for leveraging crowdsourced street-level images to gain urban insights

## Why Street-Level Images?
Street-level images contain valuable information that is transforming the future of our cities. By analyzing these images, urban planners, data scientists, and researchers can gain deeper insights into city infrastructure, traffic patterns, greenery distribution, and more.

## Notebook
I'm sharing the Jupyter Notebook used during the workshop to help you get started with extracting street-level images for specific coordinates using Python. Feel free to explore the code, and use it as a base for your projects.

## Getting Started
To use the notebook:
1. **Clone this repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mapillary-Street-Level-Images-Collection-Workshop.git
